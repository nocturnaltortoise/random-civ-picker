# Civilization Random Civ Picker

Often I don't want a completely random civ, I want to play a *different* civ to one I played recently. So this tool lets you pick a random civ, while letting you exclude civs you don't want to play. It has Civ V and Civ VI civs.

## Todo:
* Add new Civ VI civs
* Use better quality Civ VI graphics
* Add different Civ VI leaders - maybe use leader portraits rather than Civ icons for Civ VI?
